The “difficult work” that I have just described in terms of organizing columns and annotations is supported by the separate pages that teach users the importance of publishing digital annotations. The purpose of this “Create Page” function is to offer space for contextual information, such as an essay and images. In sum, this function supports further engagement with any artifact as a knowledge and meaning making practice. I really enjoy the integration in these pages in AVAnnotate because it asks users to purposefully situate their goal of working with sound and audio. These pages teach users to ask “why these annotations” and “why this audio” in creative and unique ways. This is especially helpful for students working with audio and sound as it exceeds mere listening and then annotating that experience; these pages require deeper engagement with the intersection of listening and annotating, and what this means in the larger context of the project. Creating contextual pages is more than supplementary, in this sense—it prompts users to think, consider, and reflect in a meaningful way.
<br><br>
When users create and title a page, it gets published in their GitHub repository with the other published parts of the project, like the annotations and audio items which have been uploaded. Due to this, the pages must be written in GitHub, which means using Markdown. This requirement can be a learning curve for some users, and it also can hinder the productive benefits of the tool as a resource for teaching. Not all users may come to use AVAnnotate with coding experience or knowledge of Markdown. It’s not the most difficult language, but it’s a shift from using Word or Google Docs to write and integrate images and audio. So, unlike the other functions of the software, creating pages can be where users get stuck, and this can discourage their engagement with the annotations they’ve created. Missing out on this opportunity to make sense of their exhibit severely inhibits the purpose of the software as a tool for sustainable access. Because while audio and annotations together may be a type of intervention into accessibility issues, excluding contextual pages doesn’t fully grasp the opportunities of the software. This is why I believe these pages are essential to AVAnnotate as a tool for teaching users how to thoughtfully engage with the sustainability and accessibility of their annotated artifact as a source of information and knowledge.
<br><br>
However, I’d also argue that the use of Markdown is essential to the conceptual framework of AVAnnotate. As a software for creating exhibits of annotations digitally, developing context in any other way would not be in accordance with AVAnnotate as a tool for teaching. The use of the “Create Pages” function—not alone but in combination with the rest of the software—develops the software as a mechanism for conceptualizing interventions in digital environments. In other words, the requirement of coding attunes users to their own role in sustaining an artifact in a digital space. It’s not that a word processing software would be “too easy”; the point is, the added difficulty of Markdown teaches users to be hyper aware of what constitutes the intervention that they’re creating. In a sense, creating contextual pages is an ethic of accountability as users construct, piece by piece, the significance of what they are promoting sustainability and accessibility to. While AVAnnotates response to the degradation of audio artifacts is surely rhetorical, what the software asks of users is also part of this rhetorical intervention.
<br><br>
For such a reason, I believe that AVAnnotate is an essential tool for teaching rhetoric and writing, especially as these classrooms focus on sound, archival practices, and digital technologies. This software teaches students how to develop rhetorical interventions in digital and sonic spaces with a focus on how they, as individuals and a collective, are responsible for how they compose access. Pages, while they seem like a small part of a project and the software as a whole, make AVAnnotate a tool for teaching students about the importance of rhetoric and writing.

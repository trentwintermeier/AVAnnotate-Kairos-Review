Speaking to the pedagogical and technological aspects of AVAnnotate, the software’s infrastructure encourages collaboration among learners interested in sustainable access to audio materials. Due to the software being built using Jekyll and GitHub pages—and also using IIIF—users have the opportunity to “fork” any public project and edit it or add to it. Also, AVAnnotate allows for users to “fork” projects together, creating a larger exhibit out of smaller projects. Essentially, the software’s infrastructure allows for projects to be infinitely collaborative.
<br><br>
Say, for instance, 10 students wanted to create an exhibit of 10 different audio materials, context pages, and total projects built with AVAnnotate. These are all separate, but public, GitHub repositories. These students could fork all of their repositories to a single GitHub account and create a larger exhibit which links to each single project. I’ve found this process to be relatively easy with minimal understanding of GitHub’s functionality. The only issue is that once a project is forked the original owner can’t change their project. In other words, any updates won’t translate to the forked repository in the larger exhibit. This would require forking, again, the updated repository of a larger project and repeating the process of integrating it into the larger exhibit. However, barring this issue, collaborating on a large, multi-user project is simple and fruitful. AVAnnotate’s allowance of this type of communication creates an easy way for students to collaborate on topics of sustainability and access. Such a form of collaboration is truly innovative when working with this type of material.
<br><br>
Another opportunity for collaboration that AVAnnotate’s infrastructure offers is collaboration on a single project via GitHub. GitHub allows for unlimited collaborators on a repository, which means that anyone with a GitHub account can be added to an exhibit someone has created with AVAnnotate. By “pulling,” viewing, and “pushing,” editing, an owner’s repository, individuals can make changes to a AVAnnotate project in GitHub. Once a repository is shared, it becomes available in a user’s AVAnnotate “My Projects” page, just under “Shared Projects.” This allows each collaborator to edit the GitHub repository via GitHub or AVAnnotate’s interface. So, if there are two collaborators with separate annotation sets, each can upload their own set without having to send files to one another.
<br><br>
The last collaborative function of AVAnnotate that I think is critical is the use of IIIF manifests. As mentioned in an earlier section, AVAnnotate requires creation or integration of a IIIF manifest for each audio artifact being annotated. At the bottom of each page, and even this page, is the created IIIF manifest. This can be used by anyone with access to this page by copying and pasting the manifest into a view such as Universal Viewer or Aviary Viewer—both of which are tools for viewing IIIF manifests and are available for free. AVAnnotate’s prioritization and requirement of IIIF manifests makes the software foremost a tool for collaboration. Any user with this manifest can not only listen to the associated artifact in a viewer but use the manifest to create their own AVAnnotate project with the same artifact. This is a really exciting function of AVAnnotate which is supported by IIIF. At the software’s core, AVAnnotate is creating opportunities for collaboration on sustainability and accessibility of audio material. Its technological infrastructure supports the teaching and learning of where collaboration intersects with access.
